# Spanish Song Recommendation

This project aims to develop a Spanish song recommendation system based on song lyrics. We utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques and unsupervised learning to group similar songs and provide personalized recommendations.

# Features

- Downloading dataset of Spanish song lyrics: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josshhh/spotify-songs-with-soundcloud-links
- Data preprocessing: tokenization, stop word removal, text normalization.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
- Application of clustering algorithm (K-Means) to group songs.
- Evaluation of the model using metrics such as inertia, silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Model optimization through parameter tuning.
Analysis of results and visualization of song clusters.

# Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
